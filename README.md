### Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring COVID-19 data and vaccination statistics to gain insights into the spread of the virus, its impact on different locations, and the progress of vaccination efforts. Utilizing SQL queries and data manipulation techniques, the project aims to extract meaningful information, such as total cases, death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination trends, to support decision-making processes and public health interventions. The ultimate goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the pandemic's dynamics.


### Data Sources

The primary datasets used for this analysis are "CovidDeath.xlsx" and "CovidVaccination.xlsx" files, Containing detailed information of deaths and vaccinations respectively.


### Tools

- SQL Server - Data Exploration
- Tableau - Visualization



### Key Features of project

#### Comprehensive COVID-19 Data Analysis:
  1. Utilized SQL queries to extract and analyze COVID-19 data, including total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population demographics.
  2. Conducted in-depth analysis at both global and country-specific levels to understand the impact of the pandemic.

#### Vaccination Monitoring and Analysis:
  1. Integrated vaccination data into the analysis, tracking new vaccinations, vaccination rates, and rolling vaccinated populations.
  2. Calculated vaccination percentages relative to the total population to assess vaccination campaign effectiveness.

#### Geographical Insights:
  1. Generated geographical insights by analyzing infection rates, death counts, and vaccination progress across different locations and continents.
  2. Identified hotspots, high infection rates, and countries with the highest death counts per population.

#### Percentage Calculations and Metrics:
  1. Calculated key metrics such as death percentages, infected population percentages, and vaccination coverage percentages.
  2. Used percentages to provide context and insights into the severity and spread of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts.

#### Visualization Preparation:
  1. Prepared data structures, views, and temporary tables optimized for visualization tools.
  2. Created a foundation for generating charts, graphs, dashboards, and reports to visually communicate insights derived from the data.

#### Data Integrity and Consistency:
  1. Ensured data integrity and consistency by filtering out irrelevant data points and handling null values appropriately.
  2. Conducted data validation checks to maintain accuracy and reliability in the analysis results.

#### Collaboration with Multiple Data Sources:
  1. Collaborated with multiple data sources, including COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations datasets, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic's impact.

#### Decision Support and Actionable Insights:
  1. Provided decision support by presenting actionable insights derived from the analysis, aiding stakeholders, policymakers, and healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
  2. Contributed to public health interventions, resource allocation strategies, and risk mitigation measures through data-driven recommendations.


### Conclusion

In conclusion, this project has been a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 data and vaccination statistics. Through meticulous analysis and SQL querying, we've gained valuable insights into the pandemic's impact, vaccination progress, and key metrics such as infection rates and death percentages. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by COVID-19 across different regions and continents, providing valuable information for decision-makers and public health initiatives. Additionally, we leveraged Tableau for visualization, creating interactive dashboards and visual representations of our analysis results.
